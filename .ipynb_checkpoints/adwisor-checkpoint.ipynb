      "The data is divided into the information about 2014 and 2015 unemployment levels.\n",
      "It is clearly seen that there are two main trends.\n",
      "Firstly, the level of unemployment did not change at some areas such as North Africa and South Asia where that level remained stable.\n",
      "Secondly, it is shown that that level decreased at some regions.\n",
      "Talking about details, we can see that the level of unemployment decreased rapidly in the two regions.\n",
      "It went from 11 to 9,6 points in the Middle East, and it also went down from 6,8 to 5,8 points in the Latin America.\n",
      "However, there is an unusual trend.\n",
      "In contrast to the previous examples, the EU's level of unemployment rose by the 2015 from 7,5 to 7,9 points.\n",
      "In general, it is shown that there were different trends at the different areas.\n",
      "However, the worldwide indicator did not change at all.\n",
      "Nowadays there are a lot of disputes over pros and cons of illegal music and music copying.\n",
      "Some people believe that all the content on the Internet should be free and available to everyone, while their opponents argue that illegal copying can be claimed as a theft or at least as a kind of crime.\n",
      "Actually, the opinion that pirate copying should be punished is really widespread around the world.\n",
      "People who support that position usually provide three main arguments.\n",
      "Firstly, illegal copying affects the amount of money that people of art earn every day.\n",
      "It reduces their income so people become less motivated to work at the sphere of arts.\n",
      "Secondly, it is bad for the governments economies because the illegal spreading of that content cannot be taxed.\n",
      "Thirdly, these illegal actions can undermine the moral side of modern societies.\n",
      "It means that nowadays some people start to think that something \"illegal\" can sometimes be a good (or normal) thing.\n",
      "It happens because people face illegal spreading almost every day what makes it normal for them, therefore the governments want to stop pirate copying immediately.\n",
      "However, there is an opposite point of view on this issue.\n",

      "Advocates of this opinion say that some people just cannot afford buying films and music while they need it to increase their levels of culture and education.\n",
      "In my opinion, every work should be rewarded so it is not fair that film producers, actors and musicians lose some part of their money because of pirate copies.\n",
      "However, I believe that all the educational movies and pieces of art should be free as it is important for the level of culture worldwide.\n",
      "The bar charts illustrate how the level of unemployment changed in different parts of the world across 2014 and 2015.\n",
      "It is important to note, that in some of the regions the rates did not change at all.\n",
      "At the same time, in Middle East and Latin America the level of unemployment decreased and in the EU, on the contrary, increased.\n",
      "While in Middle East the rates dropped from 11 per cent to 9.6. in Latin America the level of unemployment reached the point of 5.8 per cent in 2015 in comparison to 6.8% in 2014.\n",
      "What is also important is that the highest rates were noted in North America.\n",
      "The level of unemployment in South Africa is lower than in the whole world in average.\n",
      "Also in Latin America the rates reached lower point in comparison to the worldwide level in 2015, although in 2014 they were higher.\n",
      "All in all, the worldwide level of unemployment remained stable during this period.\n",
      "It is thought, that the creators of films and music lose a lot of money due to the fact that these files usually are spread on the internet illegally, that is why some people are sure that such things should be obliged.\n",
      "On the one hand, musicians and film producers fail to receive the money that they should actually get after their creations were released.\n",
      "What is more, such things are usually posted in poor quality, thus people who listen to or watch them cannot realise, what great job was done to create it.\n",
      "They will not be able to face the effects the producers use in their films, understand, how wonderful is the sound in the songs.\n",
      "Moreover, if we speak about official buying in iTunes, for instance, it also helps the owners of such platforms to pet money.\n",
      "What is more, due to copies more people in the whole world will know about the stuff and its producers.\n",
      "This is the way for them to become even more popular.\n",
      "On the other hand, after watching the film or listening to music on the internet a person may decide to go to the cinema or buy the song or even the whole album if he or she liked it indeed.\n",
      "The fact is that if someone knows that really good things were produced and is sure that things really go this way, the creators will receive even much money.\n",
      "All in all, it seems that the producers lose too much money because of copying as it is thought.\n",
      "The spread of their creativity may make them very famous and rich indeed.\n",
      "If a person is popular with things he or she does that will enable to produce more new extraordinary films and songs.\n",
      "Finally, it seems that there is no serious reason for trying to prevent copying.\n",
      "The bar chart represents the information about unemployment rate in selected world regions.\n",
      "It is easily seen, that the highest level of unemployment is in the North Africa.\n",
      "The lowest unemployment can be found in South Asia, and in this region we can also see stable level of unemployment.\n",
      "To the other regions the percentage of unemployment is erratic.\n",
      "In EU there is low increase of unemployment, when in the Latin America and Middle East the rate decreased.\n",
      "In general it could be found that the worldwide amount of unemployment has stable rate, If we compare 2014 and 2015.\n",
      "The highest decrease could be found in the Middle East, the percentage had changed from 11% to 9.6%.\n",
      "In the EU rate increased from 7.5% to 7.9% and in the Latin America the rate became lower (from 6.8% to 5.8%).\n",

      "Nowadays we live in an age of high technologies.\n",
      "we use a lot of them, especially the internet.\n",
      "It is a huge problem, when people copy films or music and share it in the internet.\n",
      "Such situation is very costly for the film studios and musicians.\n",
      "Some people consider that people, who download films and music for free from the internet, instead of buying original discs in a shop, should be punished.\n",
      "There are some arguments against this point of view.\n",
      "Firstly, the illegal pirate copies of films and music appear in the internet after the premiere of the film in cinemas.\n",
      "In some situations, the pirate copies appeared in the internet 2 weeks after the film started in cinemas.\n",
      "In 2 weeks the producers of this film usually can gain a lot of money from cinemas and usually the amount of money is more than a budget of the film.\n",
      "Moreover, the quality of pirate copies is often bad, with awful sound and dark picture.\n",
      "That's why a lot of people prefer to buy licensed discs.\n",
      "In this logic, police shouldn't arrest people, who share files.\n",
      "Then, it can be easily seen, that the governments of the different countries all over the world try to ban web-sites in the internet, where people can download pirate copies of films.\n",
      "But this policy of blocking web-sites doesn't work, because there are a lot of hackers, who can hack the system and continue to share illegal files.\n",
      "If police catch one hacker, there will be another one.\n",
      "This is a \"circle\", and there is no way to break it.\n",
      "In conclusion there should be said, that people will always share illegal films and music.\n",
      "In this way, the musicians and film producers should make qualitative content.\n",
      "If they make good films, people will visit cinemas instead of downloading films from the internet.\n",
      "The bar chart shows levels of unemployment in the whole world and in some particular regions, as Northern Africa, Middle East, European Union, Latin America and Southern Asia.\n",
      "First of all, we should notice, that worldwide level of unemployment in 2015 remained on the same stage as it was in 2014 - 5,9%.\n",

      "However, I'm agree with only one part of this statement.\n",

      "Musicians and filmmakers lose a lot of money every year because of pirate industry.\n",
      "The problem is it it is the theft and be punished or not.\n",
      "I, personally, think that copying and sharing music or films on the internet is kind of theft.\n",
      "Firstly, all people need to protect law and be under it, the modern rules of author's rights try to stop it (copying and sharing), that is why people who copy films and music are thefts.\n",
      "Secondly, musicians and film producers spent a lot of money and time to make their films and audios, and when they do not have money from using it by other people it is dishonesty.\n",
      "Thirdly, people who copy and share films and old music made it only for money, it looks like theft from you house in order to sell it on the black market.\n",
      "To begin with, people who copy and share films and audios are like Robin Hoods of modern world, because usually producers and musicians are rich, and they do not lose a lot while their audios and movies sent to internet, but poor people could use it.\n",
      "Moreover, the internet is a free \"opposite\" world where not all laws are acting, there is a free information about everything in the world there and music and films are also should be free.\n",
      "In conclusion, I would like to say, that despite two opposite opinions the position of people who say that copying and sharing is the theft is more clear because in order to live in free society, with opportunity to have affair wages you need to be under the law, and law said, that it is kind of foul.\n",

      "For some people downloading music and films is a theft, which must be punished.\n",
      "On the one hand it is a really problem, because people always download music and films free for a long time.\n",
      "The film or composition was done in 1990 year, for example, but people are listening it free for latest years.\n",
      "Musicians and producers involve a lot of money for their compositions, so they need to make money again by selling films or music disks in special shops.\n",

      "So, in 2014 only 7,5% of population was unemployed and in 2015 this rate grew and reached 7,9%.\n",

      "If he is used to go to the cinema twice a month, he won't go there more often or pay for films at home, just because he isn't ready to spend so much money.\n",
      "Second, film makers now earn fantastic amounts of money by demonstrating their films in cinemas, and what about musicians, their main source of income is their concerts.\n",
      "So, there is no awful need for money for them.\n",
      "Third, if ordinary people are punished for piracy, their dissatisfaction will be much higher than dissatisfaction of authors, whose intellectual property is stolen.\n",
      "This is just because piracy has become usual in our country and it will be really hard for people to stop using such content.\n",
      "On the other hand, punishing for piracy can be beneficial for the whole media industry, as it will provide film makers and musicians with more resources.\n",
      "So, the industry is likely to develop.\n",
      "What is more, people will get used to respect intellectual property, what can be really beneficial for development of society.\n",
      "To sum up, there are some advantages of fighting against piracy, but there are much more disadvantages.\n",
      "It will be better to preserve current situation, as any probable changes may cause people's dissatisfaction and even protests.\n",
      "The given chart shows the level of unemployment in North and South Africa, Middle East, European Union, South Asia and in the world on the whole comparing data of 2014 and 2015 years.\n",

      "The regions are North Africa, South Asia and the world on the whole.\n",

      "The same process is observed in Latin America and only in EU the rate jumps for 0,4 per cent in 2015.\n",

      "It is argued that free sharing and copy of music and films in the Internet does a lot of harm to the people who produce this content and those who enjoy it and those who do not want to pay must be considered as criminals.\n",
      "Personally I disagree with that claim and I hold the opinion that punishment is not an effective solution to the named problem.\n",
      "Undoubtedly, there are some reasons for punishing people who do not pay for the content.\n",
      "To begin with, musicians and producers lose money they deserved and it leads to lack of motivation to create new films and music tracks.\n",
      "Finally, losing such amounts of money hurts not only creators, but also the government budget which has its own profit from the taxes.\n",
      "Nevertheless, punishing for copying and sharing music and videos seems to be bad idea.\n",

      "This person can be a child, a student or just somebody with financial problems.\n",
      "Secondly, people who are able to pay will pay if they adore the content and they want to say some thanks to those who created it.\n",

      "It's evident nowadays that there is a big problem on the media market.\n",
      "Also it's important to understand that it's quite complicated to be aware of all transactions that happen on day-to-day basis in the sphere of buying and selling music and films.\n",
      "But some people think that everyone should respect the author's piece of art and to legally buy it as they buy food or clothes.\n",
      "Others claim that the Internet is the place where you can get all the media stuff you want without paying for it because everyone does exactly the same thing.\n",

      "They do a lot of work, spend money on the making process and advertisement, try to understand their audience.\n",
      "Secondly, intellectual property is protected by the law and everyone who doesn't follow the judiciary system's rules should be punished.\n",
      "Thirdly, it's really important to protect the unique feature of musical and film industries when only the ones who are ready to pay for access to an art should take this opportunity.\n",
      "However, some people assume that everyone should get an access to films and music because it's impossible to destroy the market of pirate copies and in this case all the limitations don't make sense.\n",

      "There are two different points of illegal downloading films or music and importance of punishment for them.\n",
      "In this essay will be explain some reasons of agreement or disagreement with this problem and will be given some examples for better evidence.\n",
      "Firstly, it can be noted that musicians and film producers have author's patent on their product because it was their innovation.\n",
      "In consequences they lose a lot of money from illegal pirate copies.\n",
      "It is wrong because people must have a salary from their job.\n",
      "In this point of view it can be understood why people who do illegal pirate copies should be punished.\n",
      "On the other hand, there are some reasons why people disagree with punishing for people which do illegal pirate copies.\n",
      "It can be proved by financial opportunities of majority population in the \"lion\" part of countries in the whole world.\n",
      "For instance, citizen from the East European's country has a salary only 150 or 200 dollars per months.\n",
      "The same time, people want to spending their free time more interesting and try to relax with music or film.\n",
      "In this situation people don't have any opportunities for buying original disk.\n",
      "In result, it can be seen that we have demand on music/film from poor people and we have supply on free download all what you want in the Internet.\n",
      "Taking everything mentioned up into account I want point that problem with illegal pirate copies need to have other solution, because punishment only will provoke to find new ways of free download favourite film or music.\n",
      "Also, in my view, I absolute disagree with punishing for people who don't have any opportunities for buying original disk.\n",
      "Government need to find a new decision, for example, some charity payments or subsidiary.\n",
      "We are given a graph which shows us the level of unemployment in different regions of the world.\n",
      "We are provided with data about North Africa, Middle East, the European union, Latin America, South Asia in 2014 and 2015.\n",
      "It is seen that situation is stable as there is no huge decrease or increase of numbers.\n",
      "Nevertheless, it can be noticed that in the Middle East and in Latin America columns, which are about unemployment rate in 2015, have become lower: the decrease was from 11 to 9,6 in the Middle East, and the gap between numbers in Latin America is 1%.\n",
      "The situation is getting worse only in one region (the EU) as column has grown since 2014.\n",
      "It can be connected with migration crisis.\n",
      "The highest level of unemployment can be found in the North Africa (12,5%), but it is still at the same level.\n",
      "The best situation is in the South Asia, where it is only 3,9% unemployment.\n",
      "The average number of unemployment rate is about 5,9% worldwide.\n",
      "It is not a secret that producing pirate copies has become a huge problem for musicians and producers as they lose so much money because of this.\n",
      "A lot of people use this opportunity not to pay.\n",
      "Some people believe that such dishonest people should be punished whereas others suggest that they just act rationally.\n",
      "It seems that there is a real rational part in this kind of behaviour.\n",
      "Because of full access to this sort of information, which people are usually interested in, they sometimes do not have any thoughts about illegal side of what they are doing.\n",
      "They believe that they just download a song, when it can be called committing a crime, judging by the law.\n",
      "That is the reason why these people should not be punished.\n",
      "Their aim is not connected with illegal actions at all.\n",
      "From the other point of view, we can come up with the decision that people who leak such information are criminals as their main purpose is not download a film and spend their evening sitting on a sofa watching it and just having a good time.\n",
      "They do release music and video and help them to be spread.\n",
      "They hack special services and steal the content.\n",
      "Maybe this is a kind of some strike, as these hackers believe that if they have an opportunity to get music and video for free because of skills, they also can spread it and help other people not to pay.\n",
      "Anyway people are more likely to watch and listen to pirate copies for entertainment.\n",
      "They do not really care about the law, when downloading a film.\n",
      "It is more a problem of education as we do not realise that our actions are illegal in these moments and we should be better taught to feel more sure about things we are doing to keep safe.\n",
      "To sum it all up, it is necessary to say that it really depends, while talking about punishment.\n",
      "It can be a good idea to become more strict, but, firstly, people should become informed about illegal part of these actions.\n",
      "The chart shows the level of unemployment in six regions in the period from 2014 to 2015.\n",
      "There are North Africa, Middle East, European Union, Latin America, South Asia and other parts of the world on that graph.\n",
      "One can see that 2 regions, North Africa and Middle East, have the highest unemployment rate comparing to other regions given on this chart.\n",
      "Now, let's look at the chart in a little bit more details.\n",
      "First of all, there is a \"leader\" in unemployment rate: North Africa that has the same rate for both 2014 and 2015.\n",
      "The second place is occupied by Middle East, but this region decreased its unemployment rate on 1,4%.\n",
      "The other regions (except South Asia) have quite the same rate in range from 5,8 to 7,9.\n",
      "In conclusion, I would like to say that the chart illustrates 3 types of changes: growth, decline and no change at all.\n",
      "The Internet helps us in a lot of cases and listening to music is not the exception for that.\n",
      "It is very comfortable to listen to your favourite musicians and it doesn't matter where you are.\n",
      "However, this process also has a negative effect.\n",
      "Now, it is really hard to fight with illegal copying and sharing of music.\n",
      "So, should the usage and production of pirate copies be considered as a crime and theft or not?\n",
      "First of all, let us consider the arguments of the supporters of such opinion.\n",
      "the main argument is based on the term \"intellectual property\".\n",
      "Some people think that music or film production is a very hard process that requires a set of skills and talent.\n",
      "So, when someone uses other people's music or films without the right to do that, he abuses other people's rights.\n",
      "That's why some people think that pirates should be punished.\n",
      "On the other hand, there are some people who disagree with this opinion.\n",
      "Mostly, they also support libertarian and anarchist political ideologies.\n",
      "Nevertheless, why do they support free copying and sharing of music?\n",
      "There are some reasons for that.\n",
      "One of the most important is that they think that music and films cannot belong to a specific person or a company.\n",
      "They say that music and films belong to the whole human kind.\n",
      "Also, these people think that this is against human nature to make money in such areas as music and movies.\n",
      "In conclusion, it is needed to say that the opinion given in the second paragraph seems more correct because each work should be paid.\n",
      "Another indicator is that the law of many countries is already protect music and film makers against pirates.\n",
      "Summarizing the information about unemployment in selected World regions in 2014 and 2015 years.\n",
      "We can say about stability level of unemployment in Worldwide on level 5,9 percent.\n",
      "In the Northern Africa we can see similar high level of unemployment rate on level 12,5 point in both of comparing years.\n",
      "High level (11%) unemployment in the Middle East fell to 9,6 percent.\n",
      "In European Union we can say about other situation, where we can see rise growth of unemployment on 0,4 percent point from 7,5 percent in 2014 to 7,9 percent in 2015.\n",
      "However in Latin America we see felt of rate on 1 point (6,8 in 2014 versus 5,8 in 2015).\n",
      "In South Asia we have very small level of unemployment without change in selected period.\n",
      "It's 3,9 percent points in 2014 and 2015 years.\n",
      "This situation we can named usual in own days, and can be describing it a stability with rising in European union from \"Brexit\" and immigration crisis.\n",
      "On the one hand, a lot of people with a good deal think that taking it is theft because music labels, game developers and film's studios less a big part of benefit.\n",

      "I do believe that illegal connection to the pirate content should be punished.\n",
      "It leads to money loss and a violation of basic right to have a property.\n",
      "The situation goes even worse if we will not forget the fact that such types of content (music and films) are produced directly by the authors.\n",
      "Secondly, due to the high popularity of illegal content there is a reduction of investments in the music and films productions.\n",
      "Every project needs to be financed properly and there is no exception.\n",
      "It is highly unlikely to create something special if there will not a necessary material base to it.\n",

      "There is no debate in the society whether people should pay for air tickets or not.\n",
      "Music and films are not usually associated with classic private goods and it has to be changed.\n",

      "There are some advantages and disadvantages of this point of view.\n",
      "First and foremost, people spend a lot of money, huge sums to do a new film or music composition and it is unfair when they are not able to get their money.\n",

      "Thus, they must have a right to be paid for their work and users of the Internet who download pirate files should be punished for illegal enjoyment.\n",
      "The reason of it can be films recorded on video cameras from movie theaters or music, recorded on the concerts.\n",

      "Firstly, it can be seen that Northern Africa is the region with the highest unemployment rate and Southern Asia is the region with the lowest one.\n",
      "However, there was no change in this indicator during the explored year in both regions.\n",
      "Secondly, it is important to admit that the unemployment rate decreased in the Middle East and Latin America significantly during the explored period, whether in European Union indicator had the opposite dynamics.\n",
      "Last but not least, change in unemployment remained without any dynamical changes.\n",
      "It can be seen that the indicator result for unemployment in the explored year was 5,9 constantly.\n",
      "Overall, the depicted information means that only in the minority of explored regions there is an increasing tendency in unemployment, while in the majority this indicator is only stable or decreasing.\n",
      "Nowadays, there is a growing tendency to copy and share some types of electronic information illegally.\n",
      "It is mostly connected with the increasing importance of the Internet for people.\n",
      "In my opinion, punishing people for doing such crimes should be cancelled, because of the content of new market, which changes under the pressure of the Internet.\n",
      "First of all, it is important to understand that you cannot control all of the information in the web networks.\n",
      "There are many people, who copy and share content of electronic information illegally, but catching and punishing all of them will be really expensive.\n",
      "The cost of this may be probably higher than the loss of money from the process of \"pirating\".\n",
      "Secondly, modern market moves in the direction of micro transactions, instead of simple selling the product.\n",
      "You can get more money from consumer, who has free access to some fragments of your film, but pays for the other fragments.\n",
      "However, this strategy can also be violated by pirates, because they can make copies of expensive fragments.\n",
      "Besides, statistics shows that this method of fighting with pirates is more effective than punishing them.\n",
      "Last but not least, punishing pirates leads to the violation of the right for the freedom in the Internet.\n",
      "By monitoring and controlling cases of illegal copying of the information, companies will interrupt private life of people and their opportunity to be free in the web.\n",
      "Taking everything into consideration, my disagreement with the punishing of the people, who copying and sharing music or films illegally, can be explained by the influence of the Internet on the modern market system.\n",
      "law should be appropriate to the instantly changing reality and deal with pirates as with the common element of modern world.\n",
      "The graph depicts the level of unemployment over two years (2014 and 2015).\n",
      "There are few regions in the diagram: North Africa, Middle East, European Union, Latin America and South Asia.\n",
      "Trend which is called \"Worldwide\", shows the average unemployment rate over the world.\n",
      "The rate of unemployment stays steady in such world regions as North Africa and South Asia.\n",
      "Worldwide rate is also stable.\n",
      "Middle East shows downward trend - unemployment rate declined for a year.\n",
      "we can suppose that increased level in European Union can correlate with amount of migrants from African countries: the more migrants Europe takes, the higher level of unemployment becomes.\n",
      "Statistics over the world didn't change - the rate stayed the same.\n",
      "Generally, the highest rate of unemployment relates to North Africa.\n",
      "It is the poorest region with low economics and GDP, so there are not workplaces for population and they need to run from country.\n",
      "International community regularly rises the question - what should we do to struggle against illegal pirate copying successfully?\n",
      "Musicians and film producers have huge losses every year.\n",
      "How can we prevent such situations in future?\n",
      "From one point of view widespread of music and films illegally shouldn't be stopped.\n",
      "Popular musicians get money from tours around the world: if millions of people like your music, songs, performances, they will buy ticket on the concert.\n",
      "Creations of talented musicians should be acceptable for people of all nations, states, equally for rich and poor, that's why they must be free.\n",
      "The opposition of mentioned point of view says that all high-qualified goods must be payed.\n",
      "The world market of films and songs lost huge amounts of money and even laws can't stop the process of widespread.\n",
      "People, who take this point of view, put on various restrictions.\n",
      "For example, it is supposed that Internet websites, which accept music, films or other materials, should make all accounts for visitors not free.\n",
      "If you often visit movie theaters, you can notice that there are a lot of cameras in a hall, where films are watched.\n",
      "That way officials want to stop activity of cameramen, who take a copy of film in the cinema and download to websites for a payment.\n",
      "To sum up, the process of widespread can be stopped, however, musicians, writers or other creative people can attract by the quality of creations.\n",
      "So, if songs are popular, people will visit concert even for a big ticket price.\n",
      "If film is breathtaking and unusual, unique, people will come to cinema to watch a masterpiece on a big screen.\n",
      "as we can see on the chart there was not any significant changes in the unemployment rate across the regions in the period between 2014 and 2015.\n",
      "EU had small change in unemployment - only 0,4 percent rise in percentage of unemployment people.\n",
      "In comparing of regions, North Africa has biggest unemployment rate - 12,5 percent.\n",
      "The smallest percentage of unemployment citizens had South Asia with 3,9 percent.\n",
      "Other regions mediate between North Africa and South Asia.\n",

      "In Western democratic societies people can think that this practice is illegal and abnormal, however people in not such democratic societies as European or American can think that practice of pirate copying is normal and So there are two point of view on this situation with pirate copying.\n",
      "Firstly, almost all people in really democratic societies think that copying and sharing music or films on the internet and downloading these files is not acceptable for fair people and good citizens because if you do that you steal money from producers and musicians, which spend a lot of time, money and other resources for making this product.\n",
      "So in these societies pirate copying is bad and illegal.\n",
      "\"Intellectual pirates\" like a stealer, so they are punished by government and societies.\n",
      "Exactly by this reason there are a lot of scandalous deals in courts of this government.\n",

      "The other situation with problem of pirate copying in developed countries like Russia and other post-soviet countries.\n",

      "They usually say, that they do not live in a good welfare state, so they only try to survive in this situation, when you do not have money for paying for music or film on the internet.\n",
      "All in all, pirate copying is not good deal, but in some countries is normal situation.\n",
      "I think it is not normal.\n",

      "As an overall trend, it is clear that in North Africa there is the highest unemployment rate.\n",
      "In contrast in the South Asia the unemployment rate is more low than in the other regions.\n",
      "On the subject of percent of unemployment rate, in North Africa it remained stable in 2014 and 2015, while in Middle East rate of unemployment drastically decreased in 2015.\n",
      "Moreover, in EU the unemployment rate gradually rosed in 2015.\n",
      "As for the unemployment rate towards all regions, we can see that in the Worldwide and Latin America the rate is approximately same, it is nearly 6 percent.\n",
      "As for EU, the rate slight increased in 2015 and it is nearly 8 percent.\n",
      "This issue is the vital part of the modern life.\n",
      "Although many people prefer to copy or to share music and films on the internet instead of buying its, the cost of this has to be considered first.\n",
      "Many people support the opinion that it is very bad situation, that all people have a free access for different sources in the internet.\n",
      "Firstly, musicians and film producers, who make efforts for to do music or film, should get the goods for its works.\n",
      "For instance, if an economist or people, who seat the governmental office have the goods for jobs, musicians, producers artist should also get money.\n",
      "However, some people think that it is normally situation in the modern life and musicians and film producers should understand, that they can't evade losing goods.\n",
      "Moreover, it isn't right to punish such people because they act rationally, when they don't want to buy for free music and films.\n",
      "Having considered both sides of this debate, it can be concluded that it is speed situation in the modern world, when people share or copy films or music, but we should think about musicians and film producers, who lose huge money and we should solve this issue.\n",
      "The bar chart illustrates differences between the unemployment rate in 2014 and 2015 in particular world regions.\n",
      "In general, we can see that North Africa has the highest percentage of unemployment of all while South Asia shows the lowest one.\n",

      "Free films and music are only two of them.\n",
      "At the era of the fast Internet we can share different files almost without any limits.\n",
      "Due to this, the problem of illegal copying is arising today.\n",
      "As for me, I totally agree with their position.\n",
      "Firstly, any film, song or any other piece of art is author's property.\n",
      "This means that, for example, only director can decide to whom he would sell or demonstrate his film.\n",
      "Copying this property is unacceptable.\n",
      "In modern democratic countries the power of law should protect the right of self-property and punish those who violate the law.\n",
      "Moreover, it can be recognised as stealing money and labour from artists which is also illegal.\n",
      "Secondly, copying and sharing music and films for free can have a bad influence on the economy growth.\n",
      "entertaining business, which includes films and music, is usually a huge part of country's income (for example, the USA).\n",
      "So, if you steal films and songs, it is equal if you steel products and create a kind of \"black\" or \"shade\" market on the Internet.\n",
      "The economy suffers a lot due to illegal transactions because it loses masses of money and product turnover.\n",
      "All in all, any type of stealing should be forbidden in modern countries.\n",

      "Also, in North Africa, South Asia and actually worldwide the unemployment rate remained stable, it did not change at all in this period of time.\n",
      "In conclusion, there was a tendency of slight change of the rate or it did not rise or fall at all in 2015 when compared to 2014.\n",
      "Although there are some regions like North Africa and South Asia, which are outliers, average worldwide unemployment rate is 5,9 both in 2014 and 2015.\n",

      "So, opinions divide.\n",
      "On one hand, those who make the music and films have to earn for their work.\n",
      "The idea of \"poor artist\" is already ancient today, as more and more people are becoming successful being musicians, actors, directors, painters and so on.\n",
      "Those are jobs which they chose and which are demanded in the society.\n",
      "We know some extremely rich artists, but how much of artists in the whole world are trying to make the ends meet?\n",
      "Probably, one of the reasons is leaks of their products, so that they are becoming free.\n",
      "On the other hand, Bono from U2 said that art should be free.\n",
      "Can we sell and buy masterpieces, or art is more valuable than all the money in the world as it makes us more beautiful inside?\n",
      "Can we make a world where art is a value more money-dependent by charging money for art?\n",
      "Also, more rational argument is that musicians earn more money by concerts they give and tours they got?\n",

      "People who are for punishing provide rather strong arguments for their position.\n",
      "First of all, they believe that copying and sharing is very harmful for the musicians and it can lead to the bad financial situation of the famous person.\n",

      "Film makers and producers want to earn more money, but people mustn't pay for their mistakes.\n",

      "And what about changes in the European Union the level of unemployment increase from 7,5 to 7,9 per cent.\n",
      "And changes in Middle East is from 11 per cent to 9,6.\n",
      "In their opinion, copying and sharing music or films on the Internet help them save money.\n",
      "Furthermore, the copying and sharing music or films in of non-original form lead to deteriorating of the products' quality.\n",
      "So, it is clear to see that there isn't any changes like in North Africa region too.\n",
      "The chart below show the highest in 12,5 and the lowest rate in 3,9 in 2014 and 2015.\n",
      "So, when nobody knows is that film good or bad and they need to buy it or they would be punished doesn't provide a good quality product.\n",
      "The best stable result is shown by South Asia with growing factories, developing infrastructure, so it give across to a big amount of workplaces.\n",
      "Practice shows that mostly unpopular singers relates negatively to illegal widespread of their songs, so they don't have another source of getting money, because their concerts are badly organized and noone buy tickets.\n",
      "The chart compare changes in rate of unemployment people in selected regions of world between 2014 and 2015.\n",
      "The two most stable regions was North Africa and South Asia.\n",
      "The less stable regions was Middle East in which the unemployment rate decreased on 1,4 percent and Latin America where situation with unemployment in 2015 was better than in 2014.\n",
      "But the social view on this practice vary across the countries and depend from relation of citizens to importance of intellectual rights and country's law.\n",
      "There are not culture of protecting of intellectual rights in these societies, so people such as musicians and producers of the films understand that government do not punish for pirate copying.\n",
      "It could be illustrated by the following example: a producer make a film and he wish he is respected and he want to have money for his hurt job, but people don't want to buy the disc with his film, they copying it on the internet.\n",
      "As the result a producer lose money.\n",
      "Secondly, producing and making music are the work and its work is same as other jobs.\n",
      "Personally I would agree with the idea that we should destroy the process of making illegal pirate copies, because it make a harm for people, who make the art and want to get money and respect for efforts.\n",
      "In Latin America there are the same declining trend for about 1% during the period from 2014 to 2015.\n",
      "Some people think that spreading music albums and films on the Internet must be recognised as a crime, and people who has committed that should be gone on trial.\n",
      "I strongly believe that there is no reasons for that.\n",
      "For instance, we always know how much it would have earned if everyone who watch it paid.\n",
      "Because sometimes for example film producers have a plan of how to present their film and if someone share the info about the film before the debut it would be disrespectful for the labour of the film producer.\n",
      "Moreover, they believe that usually when some information about the film shared in the Internet it only has a positive impact on the amount of money which producer get from the film.\n",
      "It help to boost interest in the internet sphere.\n",
      "To sum up, there is no correct answers for this kind of questions because it all depends on the attitude of the person.\n",
      "In 21 century the science go forward.\n",
      "Improvements of hi-teck has not all positive, but also negative sides.\n",
      "The next two shows us the rate of unemployment in EU in selected years.\n",
      "The differences between two graph is 0,7%.\n",
      "The last two graphs shows us the case of South Asia.\n",
