# adwisor

This is a model based on spacy-transformer tokenizer used to find errors in english sentences made by non-English speakers.
It is a course project for me, Yuliy Daniel and Peter Podlesskiy, as part of our studies at faculty of computer science at HSE.
Currently you can run the model from adwisor.ipynb.
