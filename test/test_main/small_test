I consider that using airplanes pollutes environment.
We have to know what will we do about it in the future.
I have travelled by train last year and it was amazing!
Maybe, we could lessen our influence at the environment by using trains.
On the presented charts there are proportions of good transportation by both railway and road transport in Eastern Europe in 2008.
One of the most transported goods by both kinds of transport are manufactured goods (25% by rail and 28% by road).
Obviously, because of the possibilities and large sizes of trains, machinery is carried by railway and it takes 12% of the whole proportion.
On the contrary, the smallest percent of road transportation concerns machinery goods.
Comparing chemicals and non-metallic minerals, the proportion is nearly the same in both means of transport.
Goods trains carry 11% of chemicals and 11% of non-metallic minerals, while heavy good vehicles make 16% of chemicals transportation and 13% of non-metallic minerals.
Finally, road carriage leads in food products transportation (30%) because it is quicker and safer transport for such goods.
Railway transport takes only 11% of food products.
At the same time, the most popular goods carried by rail are metals (it takes the maximum percent of all transportations - 35).
It seems clear due to the lack of necessity to transport this kind of goods fast.
Road transportation for metals is not so convenient, that is why it takes only 11%.
To sum up, the comparison of two charts show which means of transportation suit better for each kind of goods presented on them.
Nowadays there is a belief that using of technologies such as mobile phones, computers and others can lead to increase of health problems among modern society.
The possible diseases are quite diversified and people should think carefully about the consequences of frequent contact with technological devices.
Firstly the most expanded and obvious problem is connected with eyes.
People face the need to work with computers, to search for essential information with mobile phones and tablets.
