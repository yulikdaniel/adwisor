I consider that using airplanes pollutes environment.
We have to know what will we do about it in the future.
I have travelled by train last year and it was amazing!
Maybe, we could lessen our influence at the environment by using trains.
On the presented charts there are proportions of good transportation by both railway and road transport in Eastern Europe in 2008.
One of the most transported goods by both kinds of transport are manufactured goods (25% by rail and 28% by road).
Obviously, because of the possibilities and large sizes of trains, machinery is carried by railway and it takes 12% of the whole proportion.
On the contrary, the smallest percent of road transportation concerns machinery goods.
Comparing chemicals and non-metallic minerals, the proportion is nearly the same in both means of transport.
Goods trains carry 11% of chemicals and 11% of non-metallic minerals, while heavy good vehicles make 16% of chemicals transportation and 13% of non-metallic minerals.
Finally, road carriage leads in food products transportation (30%) because it is quicker and safer transport for such goods.
Railway transport takes only 11% of food products.
At the same time, the most popular goods carried by rail are metals (it takes the maximum percent of all transportations - 35).
It seems clear due to the lack of necessity to transport this kind of goods fast.
Road transportation for metals is not so convenient, that is why it takes only 11%.
To sum up, the comparison of two charts show which means of transportation suit better for each kind of goods presented on them.
Nowadays there is a belief that using of technologies such as mobile phones, computers and others can lead to increase of health problems among modern society.
The possible diseases are quite diversified and people should think carefully about the consequences of frequent contact with technological devices.
Firstly the most expanded and obvious problem is connected with eyes.
People face the need to work with computers, to search for essential information with mobile phones and tablets.
Unfortunately, they do not even notice how quickly they spoil their eye sight.
As this is not very serious problem if you find it out in the beginning of development, people can avoid horrible consequences remembering several necessary rules.
For example, they should have a break every hour while working with any electronic device.
Furthermore, they need to hold mobile phones or watch a TV in a certain distance.
The accurate numbers have been already defined by scientists.
Secondly, the frequent use of modern technologies can result in addiction.
The problem is vasted for teenagers and youngsters.
One day they start communicating with each other in social networks and several months later they can not stop themselves from using mobile phones almost everywhere during the whole day.
To prevent these consequences, people and particularly teenagers should have interests and hobbies in the real life.
Their parents or friends should also help them in this situation.
Thirdly, some scientists hold an opinion that men, who carry their mobile phones in the pockets of their trousers or jeans for a long time, can not have children.
The scientists made several researches on this subject and this health problem was approved.
To reduce possible consequences, man should follow quite a simple rule: to put mobile phones away from the pockets.
In conclusion, it is important to know just that despite the enormous usefulness of modern technologies, people should not forget about unpleasant health problems that can be caused while using them.
These two diagrams show us different types of goods which are usually transported by rail and by road.
Judging by first diagramme, we can see that rail type of transport is use most of all for transportation of metals (about 35%) while the road transportation carry metals just in 11% of all shipments.
Besides, it's obvious, that both means of transport are equal use for carrying manufactured goods (25% by rail, 28% by road).
Moreover, second diagramme shows us that the third part (30%) of road transportation is used for carrying food products, while rail transport carry food products rarely (just 10%).
Besides, we can see, that both means of transport carry a small amount of chemicals (12% - part of rail transportation, 16 - part of road carrying).
Therefore, the smallest type of good which can be transported by rail is non-metallic minerals (6%) while the analog group in road transportation is linked with machinery, which take just 2% of all road transportation.
Nowadays many people believe that modern technologies which are popular around the world and us of it with leads humanity to serious problems with health and amount of this problems is increasing every day.
Development of technologies is vital part of people's life today.
Every one has modern technology electronic devices, such as smartphone, laptop or something else.
We constantly use them in our everyday life, but just a few people recognize how many serious problems were caused by modern technologies.
One of these problems is radioactive microvolnes which are everywhere now.
So, it has a very bad influence on human's health, because it is a big pressure on brain and other organs.
These pressure could be a main reason of so dangerouse desease as cancer, which often leads to death.
Besides, another problem exists too, this problem is linked with extra weight, which people get as a result of static life.
Mobile phones and social websites replace a personal communication.
Most of all people today prefer chatting using mobile phone, instead of going for a walk with their friends or collegues in that free time.
These global problems should be solved in short time.
What about the first problem, it can be solved just with development of new technologies, which will be safety for people's health than today's ones and will replace them at all in future.
Second problem has solutions too.
One of this solution is make free wi-fi zones in the parks, on the streets.
Such methods can lead people to going out with their friends for walking.
Maybe it will'n't stop them chatting and using smartphone constantly, but it will motivate them to go out.
Another solution is to make a new national or world program which would be connected with sport.
Government should organise many sporty competions, events or something else.
Moreover, some money of budget can be put in building of fitness centers which can be out of charge for people.
This decision leads to healthy nation and healthy world.
To sum up, more technologies cause many healthy problems today, but these problems can be solved in different ways.
I think, in several years this will be not actual, because of its solving.
The pie charts compares transportation of goods in Eastern Europe in 2008.
Overall, the main trend in transportation of goods is to deliver manufactured goods.
It can be notice in two types of transport devices: rail cars and trucks.
Manufactured goods in this two pie charts is near to twenty five per-cents of all pie.
Because of that fact it is easily argued that it is the most transported goods.
So it is also clear that the main similarities are manufactured goods and chemicals.
The last one type of goods quite similar, and sixteen per-cent of all is chemicals.
Nevertheless, there are some differences.
The biggest part of goods transported by rail is metals (near to thirty five per-cents), but this type of goods transported by road only above eleven per-cent.
It is because of high weight of metals.
Nowadays innovations became to a big part of our life.
It is argued that modern technology could be used less then we can see today, because of their causing effects on our health.
This ESSAY agreed with that suggestion completely, because of increasing numbers of people who have health problems.
Firstly, my own knowledge is expecting that a lot of people have problems with their eyeside.
The biggest part of them took that problem because spend a lot of time at the computer.
A reason that computer has is the main factor of health problems.
Nevertheless, how can we become stronger and reduse bad influence of computer?
All people of the world must ask themself a question about time that they spend with electronic devices.
If IT-technology takes a lot of time of their life they must choose production with less bad influence.
Secondly, many people have problems like psycological diseases.
Nowadays, temp of life has always increasing.
Organisms of teenagers and young adults do not ready for that.
As a result of that people come to psycologists and they help them to overcome stressfull zone and became in a well mind.
To sum up, I hope that I can managed to convince you that widespread use of modern technology is causing an increasing number of health problems.
Our sociality should be careful with inovations.
It is a bad fact that modern technology causing all sides of our life.
So I hope that in the future people would find the answer to the question awording to redusing bad influence of modern technology.
Two charts demonstrate the transportation of goods by rail and by road in Eastern Europe in 2008.
The amount of non-metallic minerals transported by road is twice bigger than by rail.
While the number of metals transported by rail is three times higher than by road.
Food products are tend to be transported mostly by road.
The amount of manufactured goods transported by road is practically the same as by rail.
From the first chart it is obvious that it is prefered to transport metals by rail (35 per cent).
Food products is the most popular good for road transportation (30 per cent).
The same amount of chemicals and food products are transported by rail (11 per cent).
Less popular good for railway transportation is non-metalic minerals (only 6 per cent).
While the smallest amount of goods transported by road is machinery.
Overall, there is a tendency to drive to transport metals mostly by rail, while for food products the most apropriate way is road transportation.
Nowadays the number of modern devices is increasing.
People are tend to spend the whole day alongside with their gadgets.
According to scientific researches, modern technologies could be a great danger for modern society, especially for citizen's health.
The first enourmous problem that can be caused by modern technologies is addiction.
It affects emotional health.
Consequently, a person feels nervouse without his telephone.
The only possible decision is to develop a habbit to spend at least 2 or 3 hours a day without any devices.
The second really huge problem that could be a consequence of sitting in front of a computer, smartphone or other electronic device with a screen is eyes illnesses.
For instance, only 10 per cent of teenagers and young adults under the age of 25 have a good vision and no problem with eyes.
One of the possible solutions is to control the time spending in front of a screen and to do special exercises for eyes.
It enables to prevent eyes illnesses.
One of the most dangerous illnesses that could appear is cancer.
There was a huge research in order to demonstrate how devices affect our brains.
There is an evidence that the electronic waves influence our brains and cause a cancer.
The only way to predict it is to sleep at least 3 meters far from all devices and try to spend as less time with them as possible.
To draw the conclusion, it has to be restated that modern technologies are responsible for the appearence of such awful diseases as addiction, problems with eyes and even cancer.
Therefore, the only possible way to prevent these disasters is to control yourself, try to spend not more than 3 hours per day with gadgets and to do special trainings and exercises.
The chart illustrates the structure of shipment of goods in Eastern Europe in 2008.
It includes two diagramms which describe freight transported by road as well as by rail.
The main cargo transported by rail is metals, which is more than a third of all goods being shipped.
On the other hand, food products have the biggest percentage in the road shipment.
In addition, manufactured goods have almost the same shares for both rail and road shipments.
Food products delivery by rail is not as popular in comparison with road transport, but nevertheless, machinery transportation contains 12 percent of general freight transported by rail, while there is only 2 percents shipped by road.
According to the chart, road transport carries about 16 percent of chemicals, but at the same time, there is 11 percent of it carried by rail transport.
In conclusion, one thing should be pointed out.
Perishable freight tend to be transported by road more than rail.
Nevertheless, rail transport is able to carry more heavy goods, such as metals, non-metallic minerals and other goods.
On the picture showed 2 diagramms, that give us quantity goods transported by rail and by road.
The first diagramm consists of 6 types of goods: machinery, manufactured goods, chemicals, non-metallic minerals, food products and metals.
A biggest part of this diagramm is metals (35%).
But, at the same time, on the diagramm, illustrated goods transported by road, metals is only 11%.
Next, on the diagramm №1 we see that manufactured goods - 25%and it is almost equile quantity manufactured goods transported by road.
Machinery goods transported by rail (12%) bigger than transported by road (it is only 2%).
Chemicals and food products have equile quantity (it is 11%), but on the second diagramm food products have 30% (biggest quantity) and chemicals have 16%.
Non-material's quantity bigger on the diagramm number 2 (it is 13%).
Conclusion: the most popular type of transport metals and machinery it is transportation by rail; the most popular type of transport food products, non-metallic minerals and chemicals it is transportation by road.
Manufactured goods both types are popular.
A lot of people think that modern technology, that we have not only at home, and everywhere - is the cause of the problems with health.
We all use gadgets every minute, we are watching TV, we are speaking with our friends or parents, that situated in other place.
Technology give us a lot of opportunities for comfortable life.
On the one side, without technologies our lifestyle was indifferent from our modern.
It will be very difficult without it, for example: without modern frigh our food will date off.
And we haven't any opportunitues to save it fresh at a big quantity for a long time.
Without our gudgets, like telephone, laptop and atc.
we will leave without different information for study and for oneself.
And, the most important, in the modern world modern technology improving for help human from different home gadgets, that help at home to medcine technicks.
We can live without it, but now it is the part of our life and it will be very difficult and we will spent for easy things a lot of our time.
On the other side, there are a lot of machines, that causing of health problem.
We can feel head hurt and don't know the reason of those.
Some doctors say that it is because human spend a lot of time under the laptop.
In conclusion; modern technology are very usefull, but if human use it with mind.
Both circle diagrams illustrate the percentage of different types of goods which were transported in 2008.
The difference is in means of carriage: rail-mounted transport and road transport.
Metals were transported in the largest quantity by rail, while these goods take only 11% of cargo transported by road.
Then follows the amount of manufactured goods.
There is 25% by rail and 28% by road.
Moreover, there is no difference in transportation chemicals and food products by road, however, by road transport food products take the biggest place.
Finally, there were a lot of differences in transportation of goods by rail and road.
It depended on materials and types of goods because various cargo should be transported by different ways.
Nowadays everyone's life depends on modem technologies.
They are everywhere: in our houses, on streets, in shops.
A lot of people think that they can ruin people's health.
Firstly, everybody has mobile phones and laptops now.
We using gadjets at home, at work, even when we walking or relaxing.
Mobile phone it is a part of people.
But it damage our eyes.
If you look everytime in phone, your eyes become tiried.
A big amount of people whos eyes became to see worse.
The second problem with people's health is connected with their nerves.
In my opinion this problem is the most dangerous.
For example, computer and video games can destroy our nervous system.
Besides, there are a lot of children who can not imagine their life without computer.
The leading specialists in the field of medicine are sure that there are a lot of methods to prevent bad influence of modern technologies on people's health.
They say about declining of using electronic gadjets, and maximizing of active lifestyle.
To reduce the problem of children's health parents should pay them more attention and minimize their time of playing computer and video games.
To sum at up, it is a choise of every people.
If you don't think about your health you can continue to live with electronic devices.
But it is common knowledge that modern technologies have a bad influence on people.
And there are different solutions to stop destroying of your house.
Because all out life depends on modern electronic technologies.
In the charts we can see the figures of transported goods during 2008 between Eastern European countries.
In the whole pie chart demonstrate's the ammount of differen freight types which was transited by rail and by road.
Overall, the main part of railroad freight forwarding is based on metal and manufactured cargos while the road means of transportation more lively are used to deliver food products and manufactured goods.
It is noticable that railroad infrastructure is more conveniant for heavy use in huge ammount this is a reason why persentage of machinery transporting by rail is six times bigger than by road.
Moreover the metals forwarding by rail is three times more than by road.
In the road infrastructure case is notable the figures connected with commodity cargos like food products and non-metallic minerals which is usualy less heavier than machinery and metals.
As it known lorrys and trucks more flexible and faster than trains owe to this advantages main part of perishable goods are transported by road.
It is obvious that nowadays a lot of people are concerned about health problems and diseases which are caused by drammatical raise of gadgets and modern technologies ammount.
That is not a secret for people that longtime using of electronic devices and spending time in places with huge satelites and other communication systems can bring to harmful outcomes for a person.
It is well-known fact that radio waves are causing killer-diseases such as cancer and and invisiable for eye inner biological changes which will appeared not in the next day but will.
Moreover, lots of people which are working in Moscow subway are influenced by this radio-waves everyday and the last federal report of Ministry of healt shows that 80% of subway employee regulary experience headace and pain in inner organs.
Nobody can disagree that there are more widespreaded problems with health connected not with occupational hazards but with household lise.
Fox examples, people who is working in front of the computer all day easely admit that their sight go bad day after a day they feel sore eye and gain shortsightness.
Counting the fact that 4 billions people in the world use computer and smartphone everyday we can conclude that technologys killing us softly but surely.
There are lots of people that claims that utilization of the outfashioned technologies will help to people fight against technological pressure and decrease the lever of micro and radio waves.
Inspite of this fact the ammont of new technologies are raising everyday and the only way to reduce the harm from techologies situated in the technologies by itselfs if people will operate the techology in proper way it will have better outcome for health.
The pie charts demonstrate the goods which are transported into different ways: by road and rail between Eastern Europe in 2008.
Overall, the most significant part of both charts is manufactured goods about 25-30%.
Furthermore, approximately the same persentage has chemicals spere about 11-16%.
Generally speaking, the most viewed part of the goods transported by road is food products, because it covers approximately one third of the whole picture.
